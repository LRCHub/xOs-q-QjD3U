[00:06.10] Let's go!
[00:17.54] One, two, three, let's go!
[00:30.54] 
[00:18.96] Lost hope in love, I thought I'd never understand
[00:21.84] Couldn't help it when you took my hand
[00:25.58] Roads I ignored before, you left me wanting more
[00:28.04] Destroyed everything just to get a bit ahead
[00:50.04] 
[00:31.13] Neon lights fly by, is it fake or reality?
[00:34.35] Not sure of much but know I'm ready
[00:37.51] Soaring these streets, make me complete
[00:40.49] Full throttle, come give me your all
[00:58.49] 
[00:44.97] Engine's not keeping up
[00:47.43] With the beat of my heart, just can't get enough
[00:51.33] Revving up, make it fast
[00:52.92] Only us, make it last
[00:54.21] Till the sun's up (one, two, three, let's go!)
[01:17.21] 
[00:57.49] 'Nother shot in the dark, take me away
[01:00.61] Fizzing up in my heart, it's all OK
[01:03.73] Accelerate me until I'm there
[01:06.47] You and I reach the line, mark the end
[01:25.47] 
[01:08.86] But we'll (let's go!) Keep on goin' until the bubbles fade
[01:13.03] I don't care if I don't see another day
[01:15.63] Shocking in my heart, give me all that you got
[01:18.58] Windows down, don't hesitate a minute more
[01:21.99] Time is up, not enough, fill it up and don't look back again
[01:27.30] Carbonated Love
[01:34.80] 
[01:39.44] One, two, three, let's go!
[01:52.44] 
[01:40.87] Took a bet on love, it's better than I coulda dreamed
[01:44.07] Look at what we've done, we're too extreme
[01:47.49] Pour me your favorite drink, so much until we sink
[01:50.32] Down to the bottom, don't wanna miss a thing
[02:12.32] 
[01:53.18] The track we're on might crash, oh what am I to do?
[01:56.39] Rushing in, ignoring old avenues
[01:59.77] Race through the night, my guiding light
[02:02.53] Sparkling, I'm right here with you
[02:19.53] 
[02:06.73] Engine's not keeping up
[02:09.64] With the beat of my heart, just can't get enough
[02:13.38] Revving up, make it fast
[02:14.85] Only us, make it last
[02:16.20] Till the sun's up (one, two, three, let's go!)
[02:39.20] 
[02:19.68] 'Nother shot in the dark, take me away
[02:22.73] Fizzing up in my heart, it's all OK
[02:25.76] Accelerate me until I'm there
[02:28.61] You and I reach the line, mark the end
[02:47.61] 
[02:30.97] But we'll (let's go!) Keep on goin' until the bubbles fade
[02:35.19] I don't care if I don't see another day
[02:37.71] Shocking in my heart, give me all that you got
[02:40.57] Windows down, don't hesitate a minute more
[02:43.90] Time is up, not enough, fill it up and don't look back again
[02:49.56] Carbonated Love
[02:57.06] 
[03:03.34] Come overflow my cup
[03:04.45] I'm empty without you
[03:06.38] Make such a mess of me
[03:07.68] Don't care if I'm the fool
[03:09.45] Another night of bliss, speed up, let's make it new
[03:12.57] Love me despite the way I'm crazy just for you
[03:35.57] 
[03:29.37] 'Nother shot in the dark, take me away
[03:32.28] Fizzing up in my heart, it's all OK
[03:35.53] Accelerate me until I'm there
[03:38.23] You and I reach the line, mark the end
[03:57.23] 
[03:40.68] But we'll (let's go!) Keep on going until the bubbles fade
[03:44.67] I don't care if I don't see another day
[03:47.53] Shocking in my heart, give me all that you got
[03:50.17] Windows down, don't hesitate a minute more
[03:53.62] Love the rush, we shouldn't, don't give up, fire it up again
[03:57.46] Our time is up, not enough, fill it up and begin
[04:02.20] Carbonated Love
