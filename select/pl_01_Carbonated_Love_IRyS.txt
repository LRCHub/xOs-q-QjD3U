Let’s go!
One,two,three,let’s go!
Lost hope in love,
I thought I’d never understand
Couldn't help it
when you took my hand
Roads I ignored before,
You left me wanting more
Destroyed everything just
to get a bit ahead
Neon lights fly by,
is it fake or reality?
Not sure of much but know
I'm ready
Soaring these streets,
Make me complete
Full throttle,
come give me your all
Engine's not keeping up
With the beat of my heart,
just can't get enough
Revving up, make it fast
Only us, make it last
Till the sun's up
(One,two,three,let’s go!)
‘Nother shot in the dark,
take me away
Fizzing up in my heart,
It's all OK
Accelerate me until I'm there
You and I reach the line,
mark the end
But we'll(let’s go!)
Keep on goin'
until the bubbles fade
I don't care
if I don't see another day
Shocking in my heart,
Give me all that you got
Windows down, don't hesitate
a minute more
Time is up, Not enough,
Fill it up
and don't look back again
Carbonated love
One,two,three,let’s go!
Took a bet on love,
it's better than
I coulda' dreamed
Look at what we've done,
we're too extreme
Pour me your favorite drink,
So much until we sink
Down to the bottom,
don't wanna miss a thing
The track we're on might crash
oh what am I to do?
Rushing in,
ignoring old avenues
Race through the night
My guiding light
Sparkling, I'm right here
with you
Engine's not keeping up
With the beat of my heart,
just can't get enough
Revving up, make it fast
Only us, make it last
Till the sun's up
(One,two,three,let’s go!)
‘Nother shot in the dark,
take me away
Fizzing up in my heart,
It's all OK
Accelerate me until I'm there
You and I reach the line,
mark the end
But we'll(let’s go!)
Keep on goin'
until the bubbles fade
I don't care
if I don't see another day
Shocking in my heart,
Give me all that you got
Windows down, don't hesitate
a minute more
Time is up, Not enough,
Fill it up
and don't look back again
Carbonated love
Come overflow my cup
I'm empty without you
Make such a mess of me
Don't care if I'm the fool
Another night of bliss,
speed up, let's make it new
Love me despite the way
I'm crazy just for you
‘Nother shot in the dark,
take me away
Fizzing up in my heart,
It's all OK
Accelerate me until I'm there
You and I reach the line,
mark the end
But we'll(let’s go!)
Keep on goin'
until the bubbles fade
I don't care
if I don't see another day
Shocking in my heart,
Give me all that you got
Windows down, don't hesitate
a minute more
Love the rush,we shouldn’t,
don’t give up,fire it up again
Our time is up,not enough,
fill it up and begin
Carbonated love
